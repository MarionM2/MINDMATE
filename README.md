## Purpose of the application
Students' mental health is a serious problem that cannot be disregarded. Students are experiencing epidemic levels of mental health issues like anxiety, depression, stress, and substance addiction, which have a negative impact on their academic performance, interpersonal relationships, and general well-being. Unfortunately, many students encounter a number of obstacles to getting the care they require, including stigma, a lack of resources, and restricted access to mental health services, despite the growing demand for support in this area.
Academic and social pressures of college life can exacerbate mental health issues, making it more difficult for students to get the help they require. Additionally, it can be challenging for students with mental health issues to ask for help and get the support they require because they frequently encounter stigma and discrimination.
Given these difficulties, it is essential that we take action to address students' mental health needs and give them the tools and support they require to succeed.
The mental health assistance app will provide a full and integrated answer to the issue of unavailable, inconvenient, and impersonal mental health support. Users of the app will gain access to the following main features and advantages:

- Tools for self-assessment: Students can track their mood and interact with others anonymously  to understand their mental health better.
Evidence-based design: To aid students in enhancing their mental health and general well-being, the app will incorporate evidence-based design elements such as a community they can interact and educational materials.
- Support specifically tailored to each student's needs and goals: Users will have access to a network of qualified therapists for individual counseling and support groups.
- Convenient and reachable: The app will be accessible from anywhere and available on various devices, making it simple for users to obtain help and services when needed.
- The app will offer students struggling with mental health a practical and efficient solution by tackling the primary pain points in existing mental health support options.
